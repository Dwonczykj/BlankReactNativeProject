# BlankReactNativeProject

A blank react-native project with a map container and a funky alarm.

To Get Started:
 run npm i rnpm -g
* run: npm i at the project route.
* run: npm run postinstall
* run: rnpm link --(this is required for react-native-maps see: https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md for android)
* move any ios native files into the ios folder.
* ensure these native files are also set up in the gradle for android.
* ios open in xcode and run.
* android, start an emulator from the avd.
* open the android studio terminal at the root and run react-native start.
* then run: react-native run-android from the project root or press play in Android studio.

Thanks and enjoy!
